## Bugs and Feature requests
Found a bug or have a great idea for a new feature? Awesome, please [let us know!](https://github.com/flow-ai/platform/issues/new)

### Reporting
You can easily [report any issue or feature request](https://github.com/flow-ai/platform/issues/new) using a special template. Before you do, please take just a few moments of your time to check if it isn't reported or requested by someone else. We wouldnâ€™t want to waste any of your time.
